Our story began in August, 2023 in a restaurant close to the university with a mixture of indian and german culture, english language and greek food. A casual dinner and a beautiful conversation later, sparks flew and we both knew — we were in for a long haul! 

As time passed, we bonded over food, boardgames, and nerdy conversations. We learned to love our cultural differences, as we began enjoying the blend of Indian and German cuisines, festivals, and values. Slowly and steadily, we fell in love! Now, after countless dates, travels, and eventually meeting our families, we got engaged in November 2025. 

We are looking forward to committing ourselves forever! Reel yourselves in for a fun, inter-cultural wedding in December 2026! We are so excited to celebrate this new chapter with you - both in India and Germany!
