Our story began in August 2023 in a restaurant close to the university where we both worked. A cultural potpourri ensued, as an Indian and German sat together, speaking in English and enjoying Greek food. A casual dinner and a beautiful conversation later, sparks flew and we both knew — we were in for a long haul! 

As time passed, we bonded over food, boardgames, and nerdy conversations. We learned to love our cultural differences, as we began enjoying the blend of Indian and German cuisines, festivals, and values. Slowly and steadily, we fell in love! 
Two years of dates, travels, and eventually meeting our families we became each others' comfort and home. Many adventures and experiences lead us to November 2025 and to our engagement. 

We are looking forward to committing ourselves forever! Reel yourselves in for a fun, inter-cultural wedding in December 2026! We are so excited to celebrate this new chapter with you - both in India and Germany!
